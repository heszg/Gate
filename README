1/ I N S T A L L A T I O N
   -----------------------

- For a complete installation of GATE, user needs to read the Installation Guide
  http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/index.php/InstallationGuideV7.1

- The installation of this GATE V7.1 version is supported, tested and recommended with the following:

    - Linux distributions: RED HAT & Fedora & Mandrake & Mandriva & Ubuntu...
    - Compiler: gcc 4.4 to 4.9
    - ROOT 5.xx (from 14 to last version)
    - Geant4 10.1 (including with embedded CLHEP)
    - Optional dependencies: lmf_v3.0


NOTES:
-----

- Validated for 64 bits architectures
- The use of different Geant4 versions (other than 10.1) may cause incorrect simulation results
- Users can also used the external CLHEP v2.2.0.4


2/ C O M P I L A T I O N
   ---------------------

!!!WARNING: Since the 6.2 GATE version, the installation procedure is managed by CMAKE!!!

    - Download the sources at this address: www.opengatecollaboration.org/GATE71release

    - Install, unzip and untar the downloaded file: tar -xzf gate_v7.1.tar.gz

    - In the same directory, create two directories to build and install GATE:
      mkdir gate_v7.1-build
      mkdir gate_v7.1-install
    - Move into the GATE build directory:
      cd gate_v7.1-build

    - Launch the ccmake command to the gate_v7.1 source directory:
      ccmake ../gate_v7.1

      Warning : look at the information about following compilation options:
      GATE_DOWNLOAD_BENCHMARKS_DATA      OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to download them
      GATE_DOWNLOAD_EXAMPLES_DATA        OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to download them
      GATE_USE_ECAT7                     OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to use this library
      GATE_USE_GPU                       OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to use GPU modules
      GATE_USE_LMF                       OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to use this library
      GATE_USE_OPTICAL                   OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to perform simulation for optical imaging applications
      GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_CLHEP            OFF: by default, set to ON if you want to use an external CLHEP version (2.2.0.4)
      
     - Configure CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the full path of the gate_v7.1-install directory that you just created.

     - Like for Geant4, press 'c' to configure and 'g' to generate the makefile.

     - Compile:
       make -jN (N is the number of processor(s) in your PC)
       make install

     - Last step, update your environment variables file with the following command lines:

       • bash or zsh:
         export PATH=$PATH:/PATH_TO/gate_v7.1-install/bin
       • [t]csh
         setenv PATH ${PATH}:$/PATH_TO/gate_v7.1-install/bin

       • According to your system, you may also have to set environment variables for Root and Geant4
         - Root : source ${ROOTSYS}/bin/thisroot.sh
         - Geant4 : source ${YOUR_GEANT4_INSTALL_FOLDER}/bin/geant4.sh
