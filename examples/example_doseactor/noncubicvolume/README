* Informations:
  * This example has for purpose to show the utility of the MassWeighting algorithm for dose calculation in volumes who are not boxes. 
  * DAVW is the output of the original DoseActor (VolumeWeighting algorithm)
  * DAMW is the output of the DoseActor with the MassWeighting algorithm
